            <p class="recipe-description"> 
                I woke up with a headache the size of Uluru and a mouth drier than the Simpson Desert. Bloody hell, what happened last night? As I stumbled to the kitchen, my mate handed me a slice of moist carrot cake. The sweet scent hit me like a train, but it tasted like heaven. Each bite of the soft sponge and juicy carrots helped me forget my throbbing head. It was like magic - a cake that could cure a hangover. Maybe I should eat this more often after a night out. I'll have to ask for the recipe... when my head stops spinning.
