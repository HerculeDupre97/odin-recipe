                As a spontaneous German, I still remember the fried mushrooms I devoured moments before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The air was filled with a sense of change, and I could feel it in my bones. But for that brief moment, I was lost in the taste of those succulent mushrooms, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, served with a side of tangy aioli. As I relished each bite, I knew that things were about to change, that a new era was about to begin. And I was ready to embrace it, with a belly full of mushrooms and a heart full of hope.
